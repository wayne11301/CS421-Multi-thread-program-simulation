# Multi-thread-program-simulation

This program allow users to simulate a solution to producer-consumer problem by semaphores and mutex lock.

There are 5 buffers and several producers and consumers. Each time a producer gets executed, 1 number will be placed in a buffer. On the other hand, if a consumer gets executed, a number will be removed. Producers and consumers will be forced to sleep 1-3 seconds after each execution.
